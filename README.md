# IDERI note 

This repository holds some plugins and scripts for IDERI note or the communication between other software and IDERI note.

The scripts you can find here are __in no way part of the official IDERI note release__ and therefore not included in any support contract you may have. The scripts are provided __as is__ and you can use and adapt them at your own risk.

Feel free to try them out and adapt them to your needs. If you have feature requests or find bugs, you can report them here or (even better) contribute to this repository by fixing them yourself and create a pull request, so others can benefit from you. Thank you. ðŸ˜Š
